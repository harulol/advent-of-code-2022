</div>

My stupid takes on [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I just aim to brush up my solving skills and utilize multiple languages in my solutions.

## Languages Used
- Python 3
- C++
- Go
- JavaScript
- Java
- C
- TypeScript
- Kotlin
- Scala

## Progress

|  Day  |  Language  | Solution  |
| :---: | :--------: | :-------: |
|   1   |  Python3   |   `2/2`   |
|   2   |    C++     |   `2/2`   |
|   3   |     Go     |   `2/2`   |
|   4   | JavaScript |   `2/2`   |
|   5   |    Java    |   `2/2`   |
|   6   |     C      |   `2/2`   |
|   7   |  Python3   |   `2/2`   |
|   8   | TypeScript |   `2/2`   |
|   9   |  Python3   |   `2/2`   |
|  10   |   Kotlin   |   `2/2`   |
|  11   |   Scala    | `2/2` (a) |
|  12   |     -      | `0/2` (b) |
|  13   |  Python3   |   `2/2`   |
|  14   |  Python3   |   `2/2`   |

#### Notes
- (a) Didn't understand modular arithmetic well, had to look up what the modulo has to be.
- (b) I can't implement pathfinding properly.
